# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This project currently has no source files, documentation, or established conventions. The workspace is empty except for this instructions file.

## Guidance for AI Agents

- **Workspace State:** No code, configuration, or documentation is present. All architectural, workflow, and convention details must be established from scratch.
- **Project Initialization:** If you are tasked with creating a new project, clarify the intended language, framework, and purpose with the user before proceeding.
- **File/Folder Structure:** Recommend standard structures for the chosen technology stack. For example, use `src/`, `tests/`, and configuration files as appropriate.
- **Build/Test/Debug:** Document any build or test commands you add in the README or relevant config files as you create them.
- **External Dependencies:** List all dependencies in the appropriate manifest (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) and document integration points.
- **Conventions:** If you introduce project-specific patterns, document them in the README and update this file.

## Example Next Steps

- If starting a Python project, create `src/`, `tests/`, and `requirements.txt`.
- If starting a Node.js project, create `src/`, `tests/`, and `package.json`.
- Always update this file and the README as the project evolves.

**Update this file as the codebase grows to reflect new architecture, workflows, and conventions.**
